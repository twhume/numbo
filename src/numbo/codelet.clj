; Next: starting from p142, document the types of codelets
; THEN
; write one which looks for syntactic similarities between bricks/blocks + targets, increases attractiveness of bricks
; write one which looks at random nodes (by attractiveness) and evals to a target
; write one which makes a secondary target
; write one which makes a block

; Examples from the text
; maybe we don't need all these...
; See p142
;
; kill-secondary-nodes: destroys previously built blocks or target, frees up constituent nodes
; share-digits?: notice that a target and brick share digits
; activate the pnet landmark closest to the target
; activate operations suitable for target (e.g. weight towards mult for targets much larger than bricks)
; TODO: more on p143 onwards
; TODO: also look at source code

; work out: do we need a visualizer?
